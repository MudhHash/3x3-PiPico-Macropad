# 9x9-PiPico-Keypad
This 9-key macropad is designed using a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller programmed with CircuitPython using KMK firmware.

## Overview
This repository provides the schematics and code used in this project. The goal of this project was to build a compact, low-cost, and easily programmable marcopad which ultimately serve the purpose of offering quick access to frequently used shortcuts, macros, and commands in a streamlined, tactile form.
